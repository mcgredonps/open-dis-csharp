<br>
This directory contains  the Csharp code to implement the
Distributed
Interactive Simulation (DIS) IEEE-1278 standard, which is often used in
military simulations.<br>
<br>
The code consists of two portions. The protocol
code itself consists of classes that represent Protocol Data Units
(PDUs). These classes have fields, getters, and setters, and are able
to marshal and unmarshal themselves to and from the DIS binary format.
This code was automatically generated via XMLPG,
a tool that generates
code automatically from an XML description. The
code is in the java and cpp directories.<br>
<br>
The second portion of the code is supporting classes that read and
write PDUs from the network, log PDUs to a file, and more. These are
utility and example files that demonstrate the use of the generated DIS
code.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">XML Description File</span><br>
<br>
An XML file that is an abstract description of the protocol classes is
in DIS1998.xml. This file is used by XML Multi-Language Protocol
Generator
(XMLPG), which is available at the sourceforge site for download. <br>
<br>
The XML file is processed by XMLPG and writes the Java, CSharp, and C++
protocol code. The idea is to use the XMLPG tool to get the final
product "close", and then manually modify the source code in subversion
to tweak the last bit.<br>
<br>
The CSharp generator has been provided by Peter Smith. It is very
similar to the Java and C++ code.<br>
<br>
* CSharp implementation from Peter Smith. He wrote a new xmlpg class to
generate CSharp code.<br>
